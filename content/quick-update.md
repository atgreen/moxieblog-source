A few quick [MoxieDev][] updates...

-   The verilog output patch is in binutils
-   The moxie ports for binutils, newlib, libgloss and gdb are all
    upstream. Waiting on sim and gcc reviews.
-   The upstream qemu team have switched to git, so I've rebased
    MoxieDev's qemu against this new repository.

Also, I've been reading the new [OpenSPARC Internals][] book. It's not
quite what I was hoping it would be, but Chapter 7, OpenSPARC Design
Verification Methodology, is fantastic. You can download it for free
from [this page][].

I, however, bought this book from Amazon. And what's interesting here is
that it was printed by [Bob Young][]'s self-publishing startup,
[Lulu][]. It looks/smells/feels like a real book. I don't know why I
find this amazing, but I do. Bravo Bob!
