So here's an interesting picture from [Ledger][].  Check out the chewy center on the right -- that APP is a _moxie_ binary!

[Ledger][], the hardware bitcoin wallet company, just announced
[BOLOS][blog], the "Blockchain Open Ledger Operating Systems".  What's
most interesting to me, however, is that they have built on top of
Jeff Garzik's [moxiebox](http://github.com/jgarzik/moxiebox) work in
order to implement application isolation in their TEE app.  It seems
that additional info, including toolchains, should be posted soon.
