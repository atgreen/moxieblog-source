Eli Greenbaum wrote a terrific article for the Harvard Journal of Law &
Technology last fall called '[Open Source Semiconductor Core
Licensing][]'. I'm using the GPL as a place-holder in my verilog source,
but I've always felt that the GPL/LGPL were inappropriate licenses for
digital logic. Eli's article makes clear arguments on why this is the
case.
