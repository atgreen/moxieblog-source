So it turns out that hosting a git repo that is only accessible via slow
http is no fun.

Fortunately, the great team at [github.com][] were willing to take this
on, so now the real repository is accessible via this command:

`$ git clone git://github.com/atgreen/moxiedev.git`

I'm retiring all other repos.

Also, check out the project page here:
[http://github.com/atgreen/moxiedev/tree/master][]. Note the early-90s
era ASCII graphics in the new [README][] file. Sweet.
