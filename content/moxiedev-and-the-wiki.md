Now that the project has been renamed, the mercurial source repository
has also changed from ggxdev to MoxieDev. This repository contains the
entire toolchain, simulators and benchmark programs. You can check the
entire thing out like so...

    $ hg clone http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/moxiedev

I've also created a [wik][][i][wik], explaining how to check out, build
and use the tools. It's all here: <http://moxielogic.org/wiki>.
