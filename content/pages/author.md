Hello, I am Anthony Green.  I can be reached at <a href="mailto:green@moxielogic.com">green@moxielogic.com</a>.

If you are interested in moxie, then you may also be interested in
some of my other work:

- [libffi](http://sourceware.org/libffi/), the portable foreign function library.
- [How to Retarget the GNU Toolchain in 21 Patches](http://atgreen.github.io/ggx).
- My public [github repos](http://github.com/atgreen).

I am a long time [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) employee, currently on
the sales side working with major Canadian Financial Institutions.
Red Hat is a terrific organization, and I've done long stretches with
them in each of Silicon Valley, Portland, OR, and Toronto, Canada.
