This blog is about the development of the moxie processor core, an
open source soft-core processor, and related tooling.

Moxie is a general purpose bi-endian load-store processor, with
sixteen 32-bit general purpose registers and a comprehensive ISA
consisting of two-operand variable width instructions.  There are
moxie implementations that run on both Altera and Xilinx FPGA
architectures, a number of simulator ports (including QEMU), and a
complete GNU toolchain for C/C++ development.

The moxie [architecture
reference](http://moxielogic.org/blog/pages/architecture.html) and
[toolchain guide](http://moxielogic.org/blog/pages/toolchain.html) are
both available through links on this site (see sidebar).

HDL source for the core is available on [github](http://www.github.com/atgreen/moxie-cores).

The moxie architect and author of this blog is [Anthony Green](http://moxielogic.org/blog/pages/author.html).
