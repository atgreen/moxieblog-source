...Just in case you were wondering!

But it's been slow going. The good news is that moxie is front and
centre for me again, so let's see what we can do over the next few
weeks. And over these next few weeks I'm promising myself not to touch a
C compiler until the moxie HDL code starts executing a few instructions.

In other news, I visited one of my favourite places this past weekend.
Yosemite is a great place to reset. [Go there][]!
