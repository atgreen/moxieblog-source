Title: New Site

I had finally had enough of the wiki spammers, and decided to migrate
all of my content over to a static github hosted site.  I believe all
of the blog entries migrated over now, and I'm in the process of
migrating the wiki content over to pages you can link to from the
sidebar (see
[Architecture](http://moxielogic.org/blog/pages/architecture.html),
for instance).

If I ever get around to learning how htaccess rewrite rules work, I
should be able to redirect RSS feed subscribers to the new link.  But
until then, nobody will get any new entries in their readers.

Once I get this out of the way, I'll post something new and amazing
about moxie.
