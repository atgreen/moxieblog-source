Hola Amigos!Â  Several months ago I experimented with a new ISA design
called [ggx][]. I blogged about the co-evolution of the ISA and tools,
and it was fun.

Now, after a short break, I'm ready to resume hacking.

I'm also ready to put a stake in the ground as far as goals are
concerned. My original goal with this effort was to bring up a toolchain
for a new ISA from scratch. [Mission Accomplished][]. The next steps?

-   Boot the Linux kernel on a [qemu][] port
-   Produce a synthesizable [verilog][] implementation running on
    [FPGA][] hardware.

I hope this will be an interesting journey. Please [subscribe to this
new blog][] and make heavy use of the comments.

I've also decided to rename the processor. The ggx processor is now the
**moxie** processor!
